# speedgot
A faster way to browse spigot resources.

A front-end that should be much faster than spigot's front end, so if you just want to download a plugin or quickly view
a plugin page, you won't have to deal with the annoyingly slow spigot webpage

All data is fetched from spiget

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
